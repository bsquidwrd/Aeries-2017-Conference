Special Education
====

- CASEMIS will be merged into CALPADS, eventually.
- SEIS allows extracts that are importable by Aeries Client and Web
- Special Education information can be found under `Student Data -> Program -> Special Education`
- `-2` is `PS`
- If you see fields with `()` then it is not extracted or reported, it's just a place to store it


Tabs of information
----
- Student Services is currently not reportable to CALPADS, but will be in the near future
- Under Discipline, if a student gets 3 records then all 3 get reported to CALPADS, as compared to regular Discipline only reports the most severe event of one Incident
- Almost no reason to have records under Discipline
  - Should go under `Student Data -> Guidance -> Assertive Discipline`
- "Student is Special Ed" is shown if the student was SpEd when the incident occurred. Otherwise, it will say "Student was not Special Ed during incident"
